No encryption process detected.
No packets found which would be needed to start encrypted communication between 
the devices.
Either the devices communicate unencrypted or use a non standard encryption procedure.
If the devices communicate unencrypted, every person within receivable range 
of your devices having a BLE monitoring device can read the data your 
devices transmit.
There is no confidentiality protection for this connection.
If the devices use a non standard protocol for encryption, the confidentiality 
depends on the strength of the used protocol and the correctness of 
its implementation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pairing Phase 1 detected.
During Pairing Phase 1, the devices exchange information needed for determining an association 
model which is then used for generating and exchanging pairing secrets.
The confidentiality of the connection is determined by the used association model.
The devices exchange the needed information and then every device uses the information of both 
devices to determine the association model following a standard procedure.
Following data is exchanged and used to determine the association model:
1.  Should the Legacy Pairing mechanism or the Secure Connections mechanism be used.
    This is determined by the SC Flag.
    Secure Connections mechanism is only used if both devices set this flag. 
    Otherwise Legacy Pairing mechanism is used.
2.  Do the devices use Out of Band data.
    This is determined by the OoB Flag.
    If the devices make use of Out of Band data depends on the used mechanism. 
    If Secure Connections is used, it is enough if one device sets this flag.
    If Legacy Pairing is used, both devices have to set this flag in order to 
    make the devices use an Out of Band association model.
3.  Is at least one of the devices requesting protection against Man in the Middle attacks.
    This is determined by the MitM Flag.
    If at least one of the devices sets this flag, the devices use the exchanged 
    IO capabilities for determining an association model. 
    Otherwise the simplest association model 'Just Works' is used.
4.  Which IO capabilities do the devices have.
    This is determined by the IO capability field.
    Every device provides its input and output capabilities. 
    Depending on these capabilities an association model is chosen.

Starting Pairing Phase 1 analysis.
Pairing information exchanged during pairing phase 1:

Security Mechanism:
      Central Device:    SC Flag set.
      Peripheral Device: SC Flag set.
    ->Secure Connections mechanism is used since both devices have set the SC Flag.

Out of Band Data Present:
      Central Device:    OoB Data Flag set.
      Peripheral Device: OoB Data Flag not set.
    ->Out of Band association model is used since at least one of the devices has
      set the OoB Data Flag.

Man in the Middle:
      Central Device:    MitM Flag set.
      Peripheral Device: MitM Flag set.
    ->Devices determine association model based on the IO capabilities since at least 
      one of the devices has set the MitM Flag.

IO capabilities of the devices:
      Central Device:    Keyboard Display.
      Peripheral Device: Display Only.

Determine used association model.

Secure Connections mechanism is used.
Out of Band Data is used.
The used association model for this connection is: 

LE Secure Connections: Out of Band

Pairing:

Pairing process was executed successfully and no errors were detected.

The used association model for this connection is: 
LE Secure Connections: Out of Band
Under the assumption that the pairing process of this connection is monitored, protection of 
the connection is as follows:
The protection against passive eavesdropping attacks depends on the used OOB mechanism.
The protection against man-in-the-middle attacks depends on the used OOB mechanism.


Encryption:

A complete encryption process was detected.
After pairing, the devices started communicating encrypted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BLE Devices are identified using a 48 bit long address.
If such a devices is in advertising state, it continuously broadcasts
this address.
If this address is not changed, a user carrying such a device can be tracked
by tracking the devices address.
This is a threat to the users privacy.

Addresses can have different types in order to avoid user tracking.
By determining the type of the address, it is possible to determine the 
risk of being tracked by the devices address.

Determining BLE Address Type.
BLE Address Type can be found in the packet header of advertising packets.
Analyzing packet headers to determine the BLE Address type.
BLE Address Type determined.
BLE Address Type: Random.
A Random Device Address can have one of the following Types:
      static
      non-resolvable
      resolvable

Privacy depends on the Random Address Type.
The random address type can be determined by looking at the two most significant bits 
of the address.

The two most significant bits of the device address are:
      01
This means, that this device uses a resolvable random device address.

A resolvable address is generated using a mechanism making it possible for
bonded devices to identify a device by its private address.
It changes periodically in a specified time interval. The duration of the time
interval is manufacturer specific.
For non-bonded devices it looks like this address was randomly generated.

Impacts on the User:
If a user carries this device with him, and the device is in advertising mode,
the possibility of user tracking depends on the specified time interval in which
the device changes its address.
The more frequently the address is changed, the less high is the possibility
for user tracking.
