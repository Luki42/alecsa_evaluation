Searching for pairing process.
No pairing process detected.
For Pairing the SMP protocol is used.
No SMP packets found.
Either the devices do not pair or a non standard pairing procedure is used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No encryption process detected.
No packets found which would be needed to start encrypted communication between 
the devices.
Either the devices communicate unencrypted or use a non standard encryption procedure.
If the devices communicate unencrypted, every person within receivable range 
of your devices having a BLE monitoring device can read the data your 
devices transmit.
There is no confidentiality protection for this connection.
If the devices use a non standard protocol for encryption, the confidentiality 
depends on the strength of the used protocol and the correctness of 
its implementation.

Evaluation of encryption process finished.
No encryption process was detected.

Pairing:

No pairing process detected.


Encryption:

No encryption process detected.


No pairing process was found and no encryption process was detected.
Either the devices use a complete non standard procedure for pairing and encryption
or there is no pairing and encryption used.

BLE Devices are identified using a 48 bit long address.
If such a devices is in advertising state, it continuously broadcasts
this address.
If this address is not changed, a user carrying such a device can be tracked
by tracking the devices address.
This is a threat to the users privacy.

Addresses can have different types in order to avoid user tracking.
By determining the type of the address, it is possible to determine the 
risk of being tracked by the devices address.

Determining BLE Address Type.
BLE Address Type can be found in the packet header of advertising packets.
Analyzing packet headers to determine the BLE Address type.
BLE Address Type determined.
BLE Address Type: Random.
A Random Device Address can have one of the following Types:
      static
      non-resolvable
      resolvable

Privacy depends on the Random Address Type.
The random address type can be determined by looking at the two most significant bits 
of the address.

The two most significant bits of the device address are:
      11
This means, that this device uses a static random device address.

A static address is a randomly generated 48 bit identifier. A static address can 
be regenerated on bootup but a device is not permitted to change this address at 
any other time.

Impacts on the User:
If a user carries this device with him, and the device is in advertising mode,
user tracking is possible by tracking the device's address.
If the device is rebooted and configured to change the address on reboot, 
tracking is only possible until the next reboot.
