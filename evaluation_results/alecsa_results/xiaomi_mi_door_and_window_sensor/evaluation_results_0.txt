Reading Pcap File. This may take a while.
Finished reading of Pcap File.
Starting evaluation of device e4:aa:ec:5e:fe:b4.
Device Name: "standard demo"

Determining recorded connections.
Connection detected.
Access Address of the Connection is: 0xaf9a8269.
Communicating devices:
Central device address: 5d:a4:d4:92:43:eb.
Peripheral device address: e4:aa:ec:5e:fe:b4.
Number of recorded connections for device address e4:aa:ec:5e:fe:b4: 1.
Alecsa will now start to analyze the recorded connection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Searching for pairing process.
No pairing process detected.
For Pairing the SMP protocol is used.
No SMP packets found.
Either the devices do not pair or a non standard pairing procedure is used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No encryption process detected.
No packets found which would be needed to start encrypted communication between 
the devices.
Either the devices communicate unencrypted or use a non standard encryption procedure.
If the devices communicate unencrypted, every person within receivable range 
of your devices having a BLE monitoring device can read the data your 
devices transmit.
There is no confidentiality protection for this connection.
If the devices use a non standard protocol for encryption, the confidentiality 
depends on the strength of the used protocol and the correctness of 
its implementation.

Evaluation of encryption process finished.
No encryption process was detected.

Pairing:

No pairing process detected.


Encryption:

No encryption process detected.


No pairing process was found and no encryption process was detected.
Either the devices use a complete non standard procedure for pairing and encryption
or there is no pairing and encryption used.

BLE Devices are identified using a 48 bit long address.
If such a devices is in advertising state, it continuously broadcasts
this address.
If this address is not changed, a user carrying such a device can be tracked
by tracking the devices address.
This is a threat to the users privacy.

Addresses can have different types in order to avoid user tracking.
By determining the type of the address, it is possible to determine the 
risk of being tracked by the devices address.

Determining BLE Address Type.
BLE Address Type can be found in the packet header of advertising packets.
Analyzing packet headers to determine the BLE Address type.
BLE Address Type determined.
BLE Address Type: Public.
A Public Device Address is a unique 48 Bit identifier.
It is composed of a company identifier and a company intern unique number for the device.
This address does never change.

Impacts on the User:
If a user carries this device with him, and the device is in advertising mode,
user tracking is possible by tracking the device's address.
