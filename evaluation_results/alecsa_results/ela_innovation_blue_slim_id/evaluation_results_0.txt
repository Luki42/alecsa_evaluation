BLE Devices are identified using a 48 bit long address.
If such a devices is in advertising state, it continuously broadcasts
this address.
If this address is not changed, a user carrying such a device can be tracked
by tracking the devices address.
This is a threat to the users privacy.

Addresses can have different types in order to avoid user tracking.
By determining the type of the address, it is possible to determine the 
risk of being tracked by the devices address.

Determining BLE Address Type.
BLE Address Type can be found in the packet header of advertising packets.
Analyzing packet headers to determine the BLE Address type.
BLE Address Type determined.
BLE Address Type: Public.
A Public Device Address is a unique 48 Bit identifier.
It is composed of a company identifier and a company intern unique number for the device.
This address does never change.

Impacts on the User:
If a user carries this device with him, and the device is in advertising mode,
user tracking is possible by tracking the device's address.
